# Spotify-ETL-Project

Developed a data pipeline using AWS services (Lambda, Glue, Athena, and S3) to automate the extraction, transformation, and
storage of Spotify data. The pipeline includes scheduled Lambda functions for data fetching, transformation, and storage in S3,
with automated triggers for updates. Implemented AWS Glue and Athena for creating analytics tables and querying the transformed Spotify data. This setup provides
a scalable and reliable solution for efficient data analysis and insight generation.

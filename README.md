# Spotify-ETL-Project

Developed a data pipeline using AWS services (Lambda, Glue, Athena, and S3) to automate the extrac8on, transforma8on, and
storage of Spo8fy data. The pipeline includes scheduled Lambda func8ons for data fetching, transforma8on, and storage in S3,
with automated triggers for updates. Implemented AWS Glue and Athena for crea8ng analy8cs tables and querying the transformed Spo8fy data. This setup provides
a scalable and reliable solu8on for efficient data analysis and insight genera8on.
